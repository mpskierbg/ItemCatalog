Summary: My code utilizes python, flask, SQL, HTML, and CSS to build an application that can create, read, update, and delete data.

All you need to do is clone my git and then run python finalproject.py. The code will run on port 5000. You can open your browser and head to localhost:5000. The page will open to application. The rest is pretty intuitive.
